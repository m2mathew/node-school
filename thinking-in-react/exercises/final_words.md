# And that's it

Hopefully this gives you an idea of how to think about building components and applications with React. While it may be a little more typing than you're used to, remember that code is read far more than it's written, and it's extremely easy to read this modular, explicit code. As you start to build large libraries of components you'll appreciate this explicitness and modularity, and with code reuse your lines of code will start to shrink :)
