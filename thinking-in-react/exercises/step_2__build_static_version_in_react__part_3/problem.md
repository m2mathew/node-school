# Exercise

Let's finish our static version by adding the `ProductTable` and it's child components; `ProductRow` and `ProductCategoryRow`.

In this exercise product data is passed to the top component as properties. You can access them via `this.props.products` on `FilterableProductTable`. 

It is part of the exercise to pass the data on to `ProductTable` and use it to generate the correct number of components `ProductRow` and `ProductCategoryRow`.


# HINT(s) 

* Continue building on the solution from the previous step
* Have a look at the component hierarchy from step 1
* Use this.props.products on FilterableProductTable
* Remember to export all components so that I can verify them
